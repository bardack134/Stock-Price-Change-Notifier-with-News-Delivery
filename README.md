# Stock-Price-Change-Notifier-with-News-Delivery

This project uses Python to monitor the stock price of any company, for example, Tesla (TSLA), and sends a text message via Twilioâ€™s API when the stock's price changes by more than 4%. It also searches for news related to the company and includes it in the message.
